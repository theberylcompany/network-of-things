<span style="color: powderblue;">Network of Things</span> is the equivalent to Internet of Things with one caveat: it's on a closed network. Therefore, there needs to be new protocols and devices to develop to make sure that our information is safe from prying eyes.

This probably isn't a new thing and I'm sure IoT was developed on a closed network first. My goal is to create the same ecosystem but on the open internet.

We are coding something new here. This is technology that will provide the same level of services but on a privacy based network and system. 

## Security

Let's keep one thing very clear; **We are, first and foremost, security focused.** 

That is one of the base reasons for forming our research lab. It is to identify places where safe technology is needed and then research ways into creating those technologies in a safe, secure way, across the board.

As we develop these technologies, this is the driving force behind each line of code. 

#### Pillars of Security

1. Minimize
	1. Only use what is necessary
		1. a secure point of contact
		2. a reference to user
			1. first name
			2. username
			3. email
		3. Securely Created Password
			1. minimum of 16 characters
			2. use all characters
				1. numbers
				2. letters
				3. symbols
2. Harden
	1. At Rest
		1. Encrypted
	2. Hashed
		1. Obfuscated
3. Secure
	1. In-Transit
		1. encrypted
	2. Architecture
		1. Web Application Firewall
4. Educate
	1. Guides
	2. Tutorials
	3. How-To's
	4. Courses

### Burden of Security

Most of the burden lies upon us, the research lab, to institute all of these pillars. The sole responsibility of the user to safe practice and guard all passwords. 

## The Vision of Network of Things

The Network-of-Things is a goal with grand visions of safe and secure technology that surpasses that of the current Internet-of-Things era. NoT does not need to siphon your personal information from you or track where you are. All of this data belongs to you and will be controlled by you. We, at Beryl Labs, are dedicated to researching, developing, and sharing the information and technology that can advance mankind and not at our expense.

We desire to research, design, and create innovative technology that truly benefits humanity.
